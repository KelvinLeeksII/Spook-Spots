      <p class="hoteldisc">The Stanley Hotel was originally opened in 1909, by Massachusetts couple F.O. and Flora Stanley, as a secluded, grand mountain resort. Though the Stanley&apos;s have passed, many believe they never actually left. Mr. Stanley has been reported as hovering behind employees at the reception desk, and Mrs. Stanley can still be heard playing piano in the hotel&apos;s music room. Haunted events have been recorded at this hotel from as far back as 1911, when Ms. Elizabeth Wilson, a housekeeper, was electrocuted during a lightening storm. Though she wasn&apos;t killed the room where it happened, Room 217, has become a hotbed of paranormal activity. every single room in the hotel has experienced something strange, from clothes being mysteriously unpacked, to items moving on their own, and lights turning themselves on and off. The fourth floor is often filled with the spectral laughter of children giggling and running down the halls. Author, Stephen King, checked into the hotel in 1973, for a one-night stay with his wife in Room 217 and were the only guests that night. The Shining, was inspired by these events and the overall experience of being secluded in the grand resort hotel alone. For just $50 you can take part in a 5-hour ghost hunt at the hotel, led by a paranormal investigator. The Stanley has a resident psychic, Madame Vera and a professional paranormal investigator on staff, Callea Seck. Was on The travel Channel&apos;s &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; and Syfy&apos;s &quot;Ghost Adventurers&quot;.</p>

      <p class="hoteldisc">The Gold Hill hotel was formally known as The Riesen House back in 1861. The Gold Hill featured the earliest hotel rooms in the State of Nevada. Their hotel features the only full-service hotel in the Virginia City area and is also near a train service that will take you to Virginia City, which is nice to avoid the small amount of parking available. In 1869, there was a horrible fire that broke out in The Gold Hill Mines. 37 miners went down that day and none of them came back out. Due to this, some deem the hotel to be very haunted and many claim to hear pickaxes clanking at night in the miners Cabin room. Unfortunately, this room isn&apos;t occupied by friendly ghosts as things often get broken or thrown and whispers of threats are said at night.  Two of the rooms &quot;Rosie&apos;s Room&quot; #4 and &quot;William&apos;s Room&quot; #5 are the hotels big haunt spots. Room 4 is rumored to be haunted by the night lady, &quot;Rosie&quot;, who always smelled like heavy rose scented perfume. Many guests complain of an overwhelming smell of roses and scented objects being moved around. In room 5, William haunts. He smells of old cherry pipe tobacco and likes to play tricks. He&apos;s constantly playing with the keys, shaking the bed, and turning the lights on and off. The Hotel has been featured on the TV show &quot;Ghost Adventurors&quot;.</p>

      <p class="hoteldisc">  In the year of 1892, Henry Brown opened the hotel. Throughout the history of the building, it was never closed for business. However, it has been renovated numerous times. The Brown Palace Hotel &amp; Spa offer comfortable rooms and luxurious rooms. All rooms have exquisite furnishings and the hotel is also the only Denver hotel which has been included in the Forbes Four-Star and AAA Four-Diamond Hotel list. There are currently 241 guest rooms and suites. Room 904 is an interesting room however. One night the hotel switchboard began getting calls from room 904. When the operator answered, there was only static on the line. The most surprising thing about that was that the room had been stripped of all lights, wallpaper, carpet, furniture and telephones as it was being renovated. The hotel&apos;s dining room was originally known as the San Marco Room. It was the home of big bands and the San Marco Strings. One evening a man went to the dining room to investigate sounds coming from there. Upon entering the room he saw a quartet of musicians dressed formally and in the process of practicing. The houseman said that they had to leave, and the quartet answered, &quot;We live here. Don&apos;t worry&quot;. An engineer who was on night duty also saw the ghost of a man who was dressed in an old-fashioned uniform of train conductors. The ghost slowly disappeared through the wall.</p>
