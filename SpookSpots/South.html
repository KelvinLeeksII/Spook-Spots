      <p class="hoteldisc">Built in 1886, the hotel debuted as a year-round resort for the wealthy for 15 years. The hotel went through a few re openings after its fist occupancy. It transitioned to a college for young woman and then a hospital before it returned to its resort state today. The Hotel currently offers 72 Guest rooms which go from standard rooms to penthouses. A rumored ghost of a red-haired Irish stonemason, &quot;Michael&quot;, was one of the original masons who lost his balance on the roof and fell to his death on the second floor. This area is now Room 218 where many claim to hear someone crashing into the ceiling along with lights flickering and banging on the walls. The third floor was home to the morgue when the hospital occupied the hotel. The area is also claimed to be extremely active with squeaking from wheels from old hospital beds and a nurse seen pushing beds around. The hotel has an<a class= "hauntsite" target="_blank" href="https://www.americasmosthauntedhotel.com"> entire site</a> dedicated to various stories and experiences at their hotel. The hotel has been featured on the television show &quot;Most Haunted&quot;.</p>

      <p class="hoteldisc">Opened in 1792, the establishment was originally known as a boarding school and orphanage for boys. Unfortunately, the establishment burned down in a fire in 1774 where five young boys burned alive inside. After the fire, a U.S. Federal Courthouse was built and remained there until where General Andrew Jackson, was held in contempt of court and charged with obstruction of justice. The courthouse was demolished and rebuilt to its current state in 1890. The hotel has been listed on the National Register for Historic Places since 1965. Apparently, guests have claimed that the ghosts of the young boys can be heard laughing and playing in the courtyard at night. The second floor of the hotel is said to be a hotspot where flickering lights and sounds of children's laughs can be heard. The apparition of Andrew Jackson himself, has been seen wandering through the hotel. Room 208 is haunted by a child named Arnold who is quite aggressive and tends to shove guests and leave scratches. The hotel is featured in the tour &quot;French Quarter Walking Ghost Tour&quot; by Haunted History Tours, which costs $25 to attend.</p>

      <p class="hoteldisc">In 1796, General David Bradford, of the whiskey rebellion, fled to the United States to avoid arrest and obtained a land grant of 650 acres to rebuild his life. He later sold the property to his son in law, Clark Woodrooff, in 1820, who remolded the mansion. In 1992, an insurance company photographed what appeared to be a slave girl, &quot;Chloe&quot;, standing between two of the buildings on the plantation. Chloe apparently murdered the wife and two daughters of Clark Woodruff in a fit of jealous anger.  The hotel also is known for handprints in the mirrors, footsteps on the stairs, mysterious smells, vanishing objects. The ghost of William Winter is also rumored to haunt the grounds, his apparition is often seen on the porch of the plantation where he was shot and murdered. This hotel offers many haunted rooms for a wide range of prices. The hotel offers day and evening tours for $15 and they are about an hour long.</p>
